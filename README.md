Cross-Protocol Synthetic Reputation & Arbitrage Network

Overview

This project is a fully wired arbitrage and synthetic reputation tool with flash loans, wallet management, staking, monitoring, and operational automation.


Core Capabilities

* Aave v3 Flash Loan Execution
* Cross-DEX Arbitrage (WETH/DAI/USDC)
* Wallet Generation + Management
* Synthetic Reputation Staking & Rewards
* Event Monitoring & Liquidation Listening
* Scheduler for Rebalancing & Arbitrage Loops
* Ceramic Integration for Off-chain Data
* Redis for In-Memory Task Queue & Caching


Setup Guide

1️⃣ Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt


2️⃣ Environment Variables

Create .env file in the root directory:

ANKR_RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/multichain/f81a2b9f51026f22c1683a1daea6c3e500f914627437a2306e51892b5731132f
CERAMIC_URL=https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com
DEX_ROUTER=default
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379


3️⃣ Wallets & Secrets

Run:

python scripts/generate_wallets.py

This will generate:

 secrets/mnemonic.txt
 secrets/wallets.json

4️⃣ Local Testing

Use local networks (e.g., Hardhat or Anvil):

docker-compose up -d

Run the CLI:

python scripts/arbitrage_loop.py

5️⃣ Deployment 

Local:

kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/

Cloud (Production Recommended):

Use infra/terraform/ for provisioning (AWS/GCP/Azure).

Flash Loan Arbitrage Flow
1. Borrow from Aave v3 Flash Loan Pool
2. Swap assets across DEXs for arbitrage
3. Repay flash loan + keep profit


Operational Commands

Generate wallet: 

python scripts/generate_wallets.py

Run arbitrage loop:	

python scripts/arbitrage_loop.py

Stake funds	python: 

scripts/stake_tokens.py

Monitor events:

python scripts/monitor.py

Run tests:

pytest tests/

Security Note: 

secrets/ folder is for local dev only. 
In production, use cloud secrets manager (AWS/GCP Vault).

Tokens Supported:

WETH / DAI / USDC pairs by default.
