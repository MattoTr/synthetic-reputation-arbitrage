Setup Guide
1️⃣ Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
2️⃣ Environment Variables
Create .env file in the root directory:

ANKR_RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/multichain/f81a2b9f51026f22c1683a1daea6c3e500f914627437a2306e51892b5731132f
CERAMIC_URL=https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com
DEX_ROUTER=default
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
3️⃣ Wallets & Secrets
Run:

python scripts/generate_wallets.py
This will generate:

secrets/mnemonic.txt
secrets/wallets.json
4️⃣ Local Testing
Use local networks (e.g., Hardhat or Anvil):

docker-compose up -d
Run the CLI:

python scripts/arbitrage_loop.py
5️⃣ Deployment
Local:
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/
Cloud (Production Recommended):
Use infra/terraform/ for provisioning (AWS/GCP/Azure).

Flash Loan Arbitrage Flow
Borrow from Aave v3 Flash Loan Pool
Swap assets across DEXs for arbitrage
Repay flash loan + keep profit
Operational Commands
Action	Command
Generate wallets	python scripts/generate_wallets.py
Run arbitrage loop	python scripts/arbitrage_loop.py
Stake funds	python scripts/stake_tokens.py
Monitor events	python scripts/monitor.py

Security Note
secrets/ folder is for local dev only. In production, use cloud secrets manager (AWS/GCP Vault).
Tokens Supported
WETH / DAI / USDC pairs by default.
